                    <p>It doesn’t matter why I was there, where the air is sterile and the sheets sting.
                        it doesn’t matter that I was hooked up to this thing that buzzed and beeped every time my heart leaped, like a man whose faith tells him:
                        God's hands are big enough to catch an airplane

                        doesn’t matter that I was curled up like a fist protesting death,
                        or that every breath was either hard labor or hard time,
                        or that I’m either always too hot or too cold
                        it doesn’t matter because my hospital roommate wears star wars pajamas,
                        and he’s nine years old

                        and I don’t have to ask what he’s got, the bald head with the skin and bones frame speaks volumes. The Gameboy and feather pillow booms like, they’re trying to make him feel at home ‘cuase he’s gonna be here a while
                        
                        I manage a smile the first time I see him and it feels like the biggest lie I’ve ever told.
                        so I hold my breath
                        cause I’m thinking any minute now he’s gonna call me on it
                        I hold my breath
                        cuase I’m scared of a fifty seven pound boy hooked to a machine, becuase he’s been watching me, and maybe I’ve got him pegged all wrong, like
                        
                        maybe he’s bionic or some ****.

                        like I just made eye contact with a gang member who’s got a rap sheet the length of a lecture on dumb mistakes politicians have made. I look away like he’s gonna give me my life back he minute I’ve got something to trade, I **** near pull out my pack and say

                        but my fear subsides in the moment I realize Louis is all about show and tell. he’s got everything from a shot gun shell to a crows foot and he can put them all in context like:
                        
                        See, this is from a shooting range and
                        
                        see, this is from a weird girl
                        
                        I watch his hands curl around a cuff link and a tie tack and realize that every nick knack is a treasure and every treasure’s got a story and every time I think I can’t handle more he hits me with another story. says:
                        
                        See, this is from my father. see, this is from my brother. see, this is from that weird girl. see this is from my mother. it took me two days to figure out that

                        and I don’t have to ask what he’s got, the bald head with the skin and bones frame speaks volumes. The Gameboy and feather pillow booms like, they’re trying to make him feel at home ‘cuase he’s gonna be here a while
                        
                        I manage a smile the first time I see him and it feels like the biggest lie I’ve ever told.
                        so I hold my breath
                        cause I’m thinking any minute now he’s gonna call me on it
                        I hold my breath
                        cuase I’m scared of a fifty seven pound boy hooked to a machine, becuase he’s been watching me, and maybe I’ve got him pegged all wrong, like
                        
                        maybe he’s bionic or some ****.
                        so I look away.
                        
                        like I just made eye contact with a gang member who’s got a rap sheet the length of a lecture on dumb mistakes politicians have made. I look away like he’s gonna give me my life back he minute I’ve got something to trade, I **** near pull out my pack and say

                        but my fear subsides in the moment I realize Louis is all about show and tell. he’s got everything from a shot gun shell to a crows foot and he can put them all in context like:
                        
                        See, this is from a shooting range and
                        
                        see, this is from a weird girl
                        
                        I watch his hands curl around a cuff link and a tie tack and realize that every nick knack is a treasure and every treasure’s got a story and every time I think I can’t handle more he hits me with another story. says:
                        
                        See, this is from my father. see, this is from my brother. see, this is from that weird girl. see this is from my mother. it took me two days to figure out that
                        
                        that weird girl, is his sister. </p>
                    <p>
                        It doesn’t matter why I was there, where the air is sterile and the sheets sting.
it doesn’t matter that I was hooked up to this thing that buzzed and beeped every time my heart leaped, like a man whose faith tells him:
God's hands are big enough to catch an airplane

or a world,

doesn’t matter that I was curled up like a fist protesting death,
or that every breath was either hard labor or hard time,
or that I’m either always too hot or too cold
it doesn’t matter because my hospital roommate wears star wars pajamas,
and he’s nine years old

His name is Louis

I manage a smile the first time I see him and it feels like the biggest lie I’ve ever told.
so I hold my breath

but my fear subsides in the moment I realize Louis is all about show and tell. he’s got everything from a shot gun shell to a crows foot and he can put them all in context like:

                    UseIt doesn’t matter why I was there, where the air is sterile and the sheets sting.
                    it doesn’t matter that I was hooked up to this thing that buzzed and beeped every time my heart leaped, like a man whose faith tells him:
                    God's hands are big enough to catch an airplane
                    
                    or a world,
                    
                    doesn’t matter that I was curled up like a fist protesting death,
                    or that every breath was either hard labor or hard time,
                    or that I’m either always too hot or too cold
                    it doesn’t matter because my hospital roommate wears star wars pajamas,
                    and he’s nine years old
                    
                    His name is Louis
                    
                    and I don’t have to ask what he’s got, the bald head with the skin and bones frame speaks volumes. The Gameboy and feather pillow booms like, they’re trying to make him feel at home ‘cuase he’s gonna be here a while
                    
                    I manage a smile the first time I see him and it feels like the biggest lie I’ve ever told.
                    so I hold my breath
                    cause I’m thinking any minute now he’s gonna call me on it
                    I hold my breath
                    cuase I’m scared of a fifty seven pound boy hooked to a machine, becuase he’s been watching me, and maybe I’ve got him pegged all wrong, like
                    
                    maybe he’s bionic or some ****.
                    so I look away.
                    
                    like I just made eye contact with a gang member who’s got a rap sheet the length of a lecture on dumb mistakes politicians have made. I look away like he’s gonna give me my life back he minute I’ve got something to trade, I **** near pull out my pack and say
                    
                    
                    Cigarette?
                    
                    but my fear subsides in the moment I realize Louis is all about show and tell. he’s got everything from a shot gun shell to a crows foot and he can put them all in context like:
                    
                    See, this is from a shooting range and
                    
                    see, this is from a weird girl
                    
                    I watch his hands curl around a cuff link and a tie tack and realize that every nick knack is a treasure and every treasure’s got a story and every time I think I can’t handle more he hits me with another story. says:
                    
                    See, this is from my father. see, this is from my brother. see, this is from that weird girl. see this is from my mother. it took me two days to figure out that
                    
                    that weird girl, is his sister..</p>
