            <p class="foot_text">A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize
                 underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics
                  the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to
                   systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

                Neural networks can adapt to changing input;
                 so the network generates the best possible result without 
                 needing to redesign the output criteria. The concept of neural 
                 networks, which has its roots in artificial intelligence, is swiftly
                  gaining popularity in the development of trading systems.

            </h1>
            <p class="foot_text">Neural networks, in the world of finance, assist in the development
                 of such processes as time-series forecasting, algorithmic trading, securities
                  classification, credit risk modeling, and constructing proprietary indicators and 
                  price derivatives.

                A neural network works similarly to the human brain’s neural network. 
                A “neuron” in a neural network is a mathematical function that collects and
                 classifies information according to a specific architecture. The network bears a strong resemblance to 
                 statistical methods such as curve fitting and regression analysis.


                 A neural network contains layers of interconnected nodes.
                  Each node is a known as perceptron and is similar to a multiple linear regression.
                   The perceptron feeds the signal produced by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear.
